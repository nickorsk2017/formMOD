The formMOD system has an abstract data model.<br/><br/>
This means that you can use any libraries, UI components by combining this system.<br/><br/>
The formMOD knows nothing about your components, methods, store, and other elements of your application.<br/>
All this creates maximum comfort and flexibility for your application. <br/><br/>
